# these values to match the ones in your data, as well as any additional
# ones you want to use that might not already be in your data.
#
# The list below should remain alphabetical, and should encompass all possible
# payment methods across all services.

# These will be the values that admin interface users will choose from when

# ones you want to use that might not already be in your data.
#
# The list below should remain in alphabetical order.

# An array of email domain names used by the admin interface to determine which
# users get to access which locations. For convenience, the API allows a client
# to retrieve locations that match a particular domain name. This means that
# when someone signs in to the admin interface with an organization email
# address, like "moncef@codeforamerica.org", then they will have access to all
# locations that match "codeforamerica.org". This works for these types of
# organization domain names, but if we allowed the same lookup for people with
# generic email addresses that end in "@gmail.com" for example, then they would
# be able to access all locations with "gmail.com" in the "email" field.
# To prevent that, the API compares the domain name with the list of generic
# domains that you define below, and if it finds it, then it looks for an exact
# match of the full email address.
#
# Depending on the email addresses present in your data, you might need to add
# domains to the list below. For example, in San Mateo County, many employees
# have a generic "@smcgov.org" email, even though they work in different
# departments, and should only be able to access their specific locations.
#
# This setting is used in 'app/models/concerns/search.rb'.

#
# GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDS SETTINGS
#
###############################
#
# Google provides a "bounds" option to restrict the address search to
# a particular area. This allows Google to disambiguate between two
# cities with the same name. For example, there is a city in San Mateo
# County called 'Brisbane'. There also happens to be a 'Brisbane' in
# Australia. If you didn't restrict the search to within San Mateo County,
# and you searched for locations near 'Brisbane', Google would look in
# Australia by default, and you wouldn't get any results.
#
# The bounds are defined by the SW and NE geo coordinates of your search area.
# It should be an array of two arrays. The first array should represent the
# SW coordinates, and the second the NE coordinates. Within each inner array,
# the coordinates should be Floats in [latitude, longitude] order. For example:
# bounds: [[37.1074, -122.521], [37.7084, -122.085]]
#
# The app is set to search within the continental US by default.
# Make sure to change the coordinates to match your preferred search area.
#
# This setting is used in 'app/models/concerns/search.rb'.
bounds: [[25.7084, -124.085], [48.9084, -67.085]]

#
# HOMEPAGE LINKS SETTINGS
#
##########################
#
# In the homepage_links section below, you can customize the
# text for the header and links that appear on the bottom half
# of the home page. There are two type of links, "general" and
# "emergency", which correspond to the two "boxes" on the homepage.
#
# To edit the header for each group of links, change the text of
# the keys that are indented below the "general:" or "emergency:" key.
# When we say "key", we refer to any entry in this file that ends with a colon.
# The items under the header key correspond to the text of the links
# under each header.
#
# Clicking a link on the homepage will perform a search for the full
# text of the link, unless the text contains words in parentheses, or
# two words separated by a slash. In those cases, a search will be
# performed for the first word only. For example, clicking on a
# "SNAP (Food Stamps)" or "SNAP/Food Stamps" link will search for "SNAP".
# Keep this in mind when editing or adding link text below.
#
# To add or replace a group of links, indent them below the "general:"
# and/or "emergency:" key. For example, to add a new group of general
# links, you would follow this format:
#
# general:
#   Header Text for New Group:
#     - text for link 1
#     - text for link 2

# INFO BOX SETTINGS
#
####################
#
# In this section, you can define the content for informational boxes that
# will appear at the top of the search results page whenever someone searches
# for a specific keyword or phrase that you define below.
# For example, if someone searches for "food stamps," you might want to display
# information about the federal SNAP program.
#
# To define a new info box, add a new entry indented under "info_box_terms:"
# using this format:
#
# info_box_terms:
#   short_name_for_your_info_box:
#     synonyms:
#       - synonym1
#       - synonym2
#       - synonym3
#     title: title for this info box
#     description:
#       description for this this info box
#     url: website that provides more info
#
# Once you define an info box, all fields are required except for the url.
#
# The name for your info box can be whatever you want. We recommend
# keeping it short and memorable, and making it all lowercase with
# underscores to separate words to keep it more readable.
#
# The synonyms are all the words, phrases, and acronyms that should
# trigger the info box. They must all be lowercase.
#
# The title and description are self-explanatory. On the website,
# the title will appear in bold above the description.
#
# If you provide an url, the "More info..." link in the info box
# will point to it.
#
# To see an info box in action, go to http://ohana-web-search-demo.herokuapp.com
# and search for "wic".
#
# By default, all info boxes use the same HTML template that looks like this:
# <dl>
#   <dt>title_of_info_box</dt>
#   <dd>info_box_description</dd>
#   <p>
#     <a href="info_box_url" target="_blank">More info...</a>
#   </p>
# </dl>
# This HTML is generated by the "render_info_box" method in
# app/helpers/info_box_helper.rb.
#
# If you would like to use a custom template for a particular info box,
# you can create the HTML for it in a partial in the
# "app/views/component/info_box/" directory. The partial must begin with
# an underscore.
# See app/view/component/info_box/_example_custom_template.html.haml for
# and example of a custom template.
#
# Once the template is created, you can assign it to an info box via the
# "custom:" field. An info box that uses a custom template only needs
# the "synonyms:" and "custom:" fields because you would be entering all
# the text directly in the custom template. The value of the "custom:" field
# should be the path to the partial, starting with "component", but without
# the underscore in the partial name. For example, to set up an info box that
# points to "_example_custom_template.html.haml", do this:
#
# info_box_terms:
#   custom_info_box:
#     synonyms:
#       - health care reform
#       - aca
#     custom: component/info_box/example_custom_template
